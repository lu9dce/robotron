This software runs with jtdx installed and running
works via udp

Robotron has an artificial intelligence system
requires complex mathematical calculations
so it can't run on 32bit

Recommendations for Linux
Install PHP 8 or higher (full installation)
also xterm
make robtron.sh executable (chmod +x robtron.sh)

For Windows in the extras folder you will find
libraries needed to run php
"visual C" installs both 32 and 64 bit versions

Control the firewall and antivirus
use only the original software from microsft

Robotron is open source you can see the source code
if you want to modify something read the license first
